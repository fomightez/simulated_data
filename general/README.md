--------------------------------------------

### Python

* [Silly - A python library for producing fanciful test data.](https://github.com/classam/silly?utm_content=buffera8f2d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)

* [Faker is a Python package that generates fake data for you](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)


### R

* [Charlatan](https://github.com/ropensci/charlatan) looks to be an R version of Python's 'Faker'
* If you need to generate a more realistic, i.e., 'dirty' data to test on, see https://twitter.com/matthewdlincoln/status/1042364406796038146
>"Teaching data cleaning this semester? My new #rstats package salty for making slightly dirty datasets is now on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/package=salty "


* [wakefield](https://github.com/trinker/wakefield) - generates random R data sets and has some tools for visualization

>"Whoa, the wakefield package in #rstats is incredibly helpful for manufacturing example data. Look at the effect of this fake math camp on fake grad school GPAs!

ðŸ“¦ https://github.com/ropensci/charlatan â€¦ for creating fake data
ðŸ“¦ https://github.com/ropensci/webmockrfor â€¦ for stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests" - https://twitter.com/ma_salmon/status/993736067022053377

* [messy](https://github.com/nrennie/messy)
>"When teaching examples using R, instructors often using nice datasets - but these aren't very realistic, and aren't what students will later encounter in the real world. Real datasets have typos, missing values encoded in strange ways, and weird spaces. The {messy} R package takes a clean dataset, and randomly adds these things in - giving students the opportunity to practice their data cleaning and wrangling skills without having to change all of your examples."
