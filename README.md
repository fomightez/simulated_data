>"Go and grab 130G of long-read mock microbial community data from PromethION and 36G from MinION over here, if you fancy:
https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity â€¦ #UKGS18 - could be useful for bioinformatics pipeline validation and method development!"

>"Squigulator r10 branch https://github.com/hasindu2008/squigulator/tree/r10 can simulate r10.4.1 signals. Also f5c r10 branch https://github.com/hasindu2008/f5c/tree/r10 can do resquiggle and eventalign for R10.4.1.
Note: still work in progress and improvements are on the way. 
Thanks, @nanopore for providing the pore-model."

>"To test different approaches for assembling genomes, I needed data with known microbial content. Only long reads were available, but I needed to test the algorithm on short paired-end reads. This script was written to create short reads from long reads."
