A repository for code that generates various simulated data.

Subfolders found here concern:

Related scripts of mine outside of this repository
-------------------------

In my [YeastMine repository](https://github.com/fomightez/yeastmine), I have a script called [make_simulated_yeast_gene_set.py](https://github.com/fomightez/yeastmine/blob/master/make_simulated_yeast_gene_set.py) that makes a a simulated yeast gene set of user-determined size and saves a file of the gene list using the SGD systematic IDs each on individual lines. That script is useful for testing scripts and online services or making dummy documentation entries.
