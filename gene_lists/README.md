**DESCRIPTIONS**


## make_simulated_yeast_gene_set.py


> [make_simulated_yeast_gene_set.py](https://github.com/fomightez/yeastmine/blob/master/make_simulated_yeast_gene_set.py) makes a a simulated yeast gene set of user-determined size and saves a file of the gene list using the SGD systematic IDs each on individual lines. That script is useful for testing scripts and online services or making dummy documentation entries.

It is found in my [YeastMine repository](https://github.com/fomightez/yeastmine), as I developed it prior to the existence of this repository.
